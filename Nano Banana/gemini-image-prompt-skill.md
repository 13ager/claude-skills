# How to Write the Perfect Image Generation Prompt for Nano Banana (Gemini AI)

Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) makes AI image creation and editing conversational and remarkably flexible. To consistently get stunning, accurate results, follow these consumer-friendly best practices:

---

## Key Principles

- **Describe the scene, don't just list keywords.** Use narrative, descriptive sentences instead of single words. The model understands context and intent much better this way.
- **Be specific and explicit.** Detail your subject, environment, style, lighting, and desired mood. More specifics lead to more control over the result.
- **Iterate and refine.** It's normal to get closer to your ideal image over multiple turns. Ask for tweaks: "Change the lighting to warmer," or "Make the character look more serious."
- **State the purpose and context.** Example: “Create a logo for a minimalist skincare brand.” Giving the model your intent helps steer its creative output.
- **Use photographic and artistic terminology.** Mention camera angle, lens type, color schemes, art style ("in watercolor," "as an anime character").
- **Semantic negatives:** Describe what you want, not just what you don’t want ("A deserted city street at dawn" vs. "no cars").

## Editing & Multi-Image Prompts

- **Local/Edit Example:** “Using the provided image of my cat, please add a small wizard hat that fits the lighting and pose.”
- **Inpainting:** “Change only the blue sofa to vintage brown leather; keep everything else identical.”
- **Style Transfer:** “Transform the photo into impressionist style, keep the composition.”
- **Compositional Blend:** “Combine the subject from image 1 with the background of image 2. Scene: a toy robot in a child’s bedroom.”

## Advanced Tips

- **Multi-turn refinement:** Make one change at a time and re-upload the edited image for further tweaks.
- **Preserve likeness:** For edits, specify “maintain facial features” or “keep logo unchanged” to retain character consistency[1][11][12][15].
- **Short text for accurate rendering:** Limit overlaid text to under 25 characters.
- **Aspect ratios:** Specify if you need 16:9, 1:1, etc., but expect most reliable results with 1:1 and standard portrait/landscape ratios[15].

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Vague prompts:** “Make it better” results in unpredictable output.
- **Keyword stuffing:** Model responds better to flowing, descriptive text than to lists.
- **Editing too much at once:** Best to adjust one element per prompt.
