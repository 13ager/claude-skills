A growing collection of **Claude Skills** designed to help you write smarter, more cinematic, and more precise prompts for creative AI tools — **Perplexity**, **Sora 2**, **Suno**, and **Nano Banana**.  
This repo is part **prompt-engineering lab**, part **creative dojo** — where we learn how to talk to generative systems so they deliver *exactly* what you imagine (or something better).

## 🎯 Purpose

Claude is a remarkable writer — but when it comes to creative control, *how* you prompt makes all the difference.  
These skills turn Claude into a **collaborator**, not just a text generator.

Each Skill:
- Encodes structure and best practices for specific AI tools.
- Produces consistent, replicable creative results.
- Encourages exploration over perfection.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Copy** a skill file (`.json` or `.txt`) into your Claude workspace or Skill Builder.  
2. **Invoke** it with `/skill-name` or by typing a natural command (e.g., “Use the cinematic Sora style”).  
3. **Adapt** examples to your project — tweak tone, tempo, or visual intent.  
4. **Iterate** — experiment, remix, refine, and submit improvements!

Example:
```bash
/skills/sora2/cinem
