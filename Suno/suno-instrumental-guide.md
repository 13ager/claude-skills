## Introduction

Suno AI excels at creating instrumental music when prompted correctly. This guide provides proven formulas, meta tags, and techniques for generating professional-quality instrumental tracks without vocals or lyrics. The methods outlined here work across all Suno versions (v4, v4.5, v4.5+, and v5) with emphasis on Custom Mode for maximum control.

**Key Principle**: Be specific, structured, and intentional. Suno interprets prompts semantically—the more precise your instructions, the better your instrumental output.

---

## Understanding Suno's Instrumental Mode

### Activating Instrumental Mode

**Method 1: Toggle Instrumental Mode**
- Navigate to **Create** → Enable **Custom Mode**
- Toggle the **Instrumental** switch to ON
- This ensures Suno focuses exclusively on music without generating vocals

**Method 2: Custom Mode with Exclude Styles**
- In **Custom Mode**, use the **Style of Music** field for your prompt
- In the **Exclude Styles** field (Pro/Premier only), add:
  - `vocals`
  - `male vocals`
  - `female vocals`
  - `singing`
  - `lyrics`

**Method 3: Lyrics Box with Instrumental Tags**
- Use Custom Mode with meta tags in the **Lyrics** box
- Enter only instrumental structure tags like `[Intro]`, `[Build]`, `[Drop]` with no actual lyrics
- Leave the text content empty or use punctuation marks (`. . ! .. .!`)

## The Four Pillars of Effective Instrumental Prompts

Every high-quality instrumental prompt should include these four core elements:

### 1. **Genre & Style**
Be as specific as possible. Instead of "electronic," use "synthwave" or "ambient techno."

**Examples:**
- `Cinematic orchestral`
- `Lo-fi hip hop`
- `Progressive trance`
- `Jazz fusion`
- `Ambient electronic`
- `Downtempo chillout`

### 2. **Mood & Atmosphere**
Describe the emotional essence and energy level.

**Examples:**
- `Ethereal and dreamy`
- `Dark and brooding`
- `Uplifting and euphoric`
- `Melancholic and introspective`
- `Energetic and driving`
- `Serene and peaceful`

### 3. **Instrumentation & Sound Design**
Specify the key instruments, textures, and production elements.

**Examples:**
- `Analog synths, deep bass, reverb-heavy drums`
- `Fingerstyle acoustic guitar, soft percussion`
- `Electric piano, warm strings, subtle pads`
- `Distorted synth lines, 808 bass, glitchy percussion`
- `Orchestral strings, brass section, timpani drums`
- `Nylon guitar, hand percussion, wooden flutes`

### 4. **Structure & Dynamics**
Define how the track should evolve—builds, drops, transitions, and energy flow.

**Examples:**
- `Slow intro, gradual build, powerful drop`
- `Steady groove with dynamic shifts`
- `Ambient opening, rhythmic development, fade out`
- `Verses with instrumental breaks, anthemic chorus sections`
- `Building intensity throughout, climactic finale`

---

## Prompt Structure Formula

### Basic Formula

```
[Genre] [Mood] featuring [Instrumentation], with [Structure/Dynamics], [Tempo]
```

**Example:**
```
Ambient electronic, serene and peaceful, featuring soft synth pads, gentle piano, and light percussion, with a gradual build and fade out, 60 BPM
```

### Advanced Formula (Custom Mode)

```
[Genre: specific subgenre]
[Mood: emotional descriptor]
[Tempo: BPM or tempo term]
[Key: musical key]
[Time Signature: meter]
[Instrumentation: detailed list]
[Structure: section flow]
[Production: effects and processing]
```

**Example:**
```
[Genre: Synthwave, Retro 80s]
[Mood: Nostalgic, Futuristic]
[Tempo: 110 BPM]
[Key: A Minor]
[Instrumentation: Analog synths, deep bass, reverb-heavy drums, gated synth pads]
[Structure: Intro → Build → Drop → Breakdown → Final Drop → Outro]
[Production: Tape saturation, vintage reverb, sidechain compression]
```

### JSON-Style Template (Advanced)

For maximum control, some users employ JSON-like formatting:

```
[meta_object: arrangement]
[{
  "tempo": 120,
  "key": "E minor",
  "time_signature": "4/4",
  "structure": ["Intro", "Build", "Drop", "Breakdown", "Climax", "Outro"],
  "instrumentation": {
    "drums": ["808 bass", "crisp snares", "rolling hi-hats"],
    "melodic": ["synth pads", "arpeggiator leads", "electric piano"],
    "effects": ["reverb", "delay", "risers", "vinyl crackle"]
  }
}]
```

## Tempo and BPM Control

Suno interprets tempo **semantically**, not like a digital audio workstation (DAW). Use both classical tempo terms and BPM values for best results.

### Tempo Terminology Reference

**Very Slow (20-66 BPM):**
- `Grave` - 20-40 BPM, extremely solemn
- `Largo` - 40-60 BPM, broad and slow
- `Larghetto` - 60-66 BPM, slightly faster than Largo
- `Lento` - 45-60 BPM, slow and broad
- `Adagio` - 66-76 BPM, slow and stately

**Moderate (76-120 BPM):**
- `Andante` - 76-108 BPM, walking pace
- `Moderato` - 108-120 BPM, moderate pace
- `Allegretto` - 112-120 BPM, moderately fast

**Fast (120-176 BPM):**
- `Allegro` - 120-168 BPM, fast and lively
- `Vivace` - 140-176 BPM, spirited and fast

**Very Fast (168-200+ BPM):**
- `Presto` - 168-200 BPM, very fast
- `Prestissimo` - 200+ BPM, as fast as possible

### Expressive Tempo Modifiers

- `Accelerando` - Gradually speeding up
- `Ritardando` - Gradually slowing down
- `Rubato` - Flexible, expressive tempo
- `Con moto` - With motion
- `Tranquillo` - Calm, slower mood

### Best Practices for Tempo

1. **Combine BPM with descriptive terms:**
   - `120 BPM, Allegro, energetic`
   - `Slow, 60 BPM, meditative pace`

2. **Match tempo to genre expectations:**
   - Ambient: 50-80 BPM
   - Lo-fi hip hop: 70-90 BPM
   - House: 120-130 BPM
   - Drum & Bass: 160-180 BPM
   - Trance: 130-150 BPM

3. **Use tempo modifiers for dynamic structure:**
   ```
   [Intro - Andante, 80 BPM]
   [Build - Accelerando]
   [Drop - Allegro, 140 BPM]
   ```

## Advanced Settings: Style, Weirdness, and Audio Influence

In **Custom Mode**, access **Advanced Options** to fine-tune creative control with three independent sliders.

### Style Influence (0-100%)

**What it does:** Controls how closely Suno adheres to your genre, mood, and reference descriptions.

- **0-40%**: Loose interpretation, more variety and experimentation
- **50-70%**: Balanced adherence to prompt
- **80-100%**: Strict adherence to specified style

**Best for Instrumentals:** 70-85%
- Maintains genre consistency while allowing musical creativity

### Weirdness (0-100%)

**What it does:** Controls experimental creativity, unexpected elements, and unconventional arrangements.

- **0-30%**: Safe, predictable, conventional structures
- **40-60%**: Natural variation, human-like phrasing (sweet spot)
- **70-100%**: Chaotic, experimental, unpredictable

**Best for Instrumentals:**
- **Ambient/Cinematic:** 30-50% (maintains atmosphere)
- **Electronic/EDM:** 50-70% (adds interesting variation)

## Production Quality Enhancement

### Using Remaster Feature

**What Remaster Does:**
- Regenerates tracks using latest Suno version (v4/v4.5)
- Improves audio fidelity, clarity, and production quality
- Rebuilds audio without changing structure

**How to Remaster:**
1. Select your instrumental track
2. Click "..." → Create → Remaster
3. Suno generates 2 new versions
4. Compare and choose the best

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use for instrumentals with good structure but poor mix
- ✅ Ambient and synth genres benefit most from stacking (remaster multiple times)
- ❌ Don't overuse (1-2 passes maximum for most tracks)
- ✅ Always keep original file for comparison

**Advanced Technique: Persona-Based Remastering**
1. Create a Persona from your original instrumental
2. Use that Persona to create a "Cover" of the track
3. Results in enhanced v4.5 quality with original character

### Stem Separation

**Access Stems:**
- Click "..." → Create → Get Stems
- Suno separates into instrumental and vocal tracks (vocals should be empty for pure instrumentals)

**Use Cases:**
- Isolate specific instruments for external mixing
- Remove any accidental vocal artifacts
- Create variations by mixing different stem versions

**Pro Tip:** After getting stems, remaster the instrumental stem for cleanest possible output.

### Multi-Remaster Technique

Create 3-4 remasters with different sonic characteristics:
1. **Wide mix** - Spacious stereo field
2. **Bass-heavy mix** - Enhanced low end
3. **Bright mix** - Emphasized high frequencies
4. **Balanced mix** - Even frequency distribution

Export all versions and choose the best, or layer them in a DAW for full spectrum sound.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Use vague, generic descriptions
**Bad:** `Electronic music`
**Good:** `Progressive house, 128 BPM, featuring deep bass, crisp drums, layered synth pads, with build-drop structure`

### ❌ Don't: Forget to specify "instrumental" or exclude vocals
- Always use Instrumental toggle OR Exclude Styles field
- Don't assume Suno will automatically create instrumental-only music

### ❌ Don't: Overload prompts with too many instructions
**Bad:** `Ambient techno with piano and guitar and drums and bass and synths with lots of reverb and delay and distortion and compression in A minor 120 BPM 4/4 time with intro verse chorus bridge outro...`
**Good:** `Ambient techno, 120 BPM, A minor, featuring piano, guitar, synth pads, with reverb-heavy production and dynamic structure`

### ❌ Don't: Ignore genre-appropriate meta tags
- `[Bass Drop]` works for EDM, not acoustic folk
- `[Bluegrass Banjo Interlude]` works for country, not techno
- Match tags to genre expectations

### ❌ Don't: Set weirdness too low (<30%)
- Results in flat, robotic, lifeless instrumentals
- 40-50% is the sweet spot for natural variation

### ❌ Don't: Mix incompatible genres without intention
**Bad:** `Classical orchestra trap beats`
**Good:** `Trap beats with orchestral string elements and cinematic atmosphere`

### ❌ Don't: Forget dynamic structure
- Static energy throughout = boring instrumental
- Include builds, drops, breakdowns, dynamic variation

### ✅ Do: Iterate and experiment
- Generate multiple versions with slight prompt variations
- Test different weirdness and style settings
- Save successful prompts for future use
